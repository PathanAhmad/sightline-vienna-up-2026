# PLAN — Challenge 2 build

48 hours. APG photo-QC prototype. Three deliverables: working pipeline, deficiency report, 3-minute demo.

---

## The one-liner

> Ingest trench photos + a GeoJSON route. Position each photo along the trench network using overlay-OCR'd lat/lon and address. Score each **LineString trench segment** **green / yellow / red** by the **photo-every-5m density rule** + per-photo compliance checks. Produce a reviewer-ready deficiency report.

## The rubric

Two layers — both need to be green for a segment to be GREEN:

**Layer A — per-segment spatial coverage** (the rule the reference ÖGIG deck reveals):
- **GREEN** — at least one compliant photo per 5 m of trench length, no gaps > 5 m.
- **YELLOW** — photos exist but density < 1/5m, OR photos exist but a quality check fails.
- **RED** — fewer than 1 photo per 10 m, OR no photos at all.

**Layer B — per-photo compliance checks** (superset of the APG brief + ÖGIG-deck additions):

| # | Check | Source | How we detect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Warning tape (Warnband) visible** | APG brief | Claude vision — yes / no / occluded |
| 2 | **Sand bedding visible** before backfilling | APG brief + ÖGIG deck | Claude vision — yes / no / occluded |
| 3 | **Side view / trench profile** present | APG brief | Claude vision — yes / no |
| 4 | **Trench depth confirmed** with visible reference (ruler / measuring rod) | APG brief + ÖGIG deck ("ruler readable") | Claude vision — depth reference visible yes/no; OCR the value if a ruler is in frame |
| 5 | **Duplicate / reused photo** across the corpus | APG brief (our differentiator) | `imagehash.phash` Hamming-distance ≤ 6 |
| 6 | **GPS / location consistent** with declared project site | APG brief + ÖGIG deck ("GPS stamp") | Overlay address / lat/lon + paper-label FCP code; cross-check against FCP polygon and SiteCluster |
| 7 | **Pipe ends sealed** (white end-caps on duct bundle) | ÖGIG deck only — **not in the APG brief** but industry-standard | Claude vision — yes / no / occluded |
| 8 | **No personal data** (faces / license plates) visible | ÖGIG deck only — NIS2 compliance | Claude vision — yes / no |

**How Layer B feeds Layer A.** A photo counts as **compliant** for the 5m density rule if ALL of these hold:
- `relevance = scorable` (the relevance gate passed)
- `personal_data_visible = no` (NIS2 clean)
- It is NOT a duplicate of another photo we've already counted (check 5)
- Its overlay address / lat/lon snapped to a segment without a >150m disagreement (check 6 passed)
- The phase-relevant subset of `{warning_tape, sand_bedding, side_view, depth_reference, duct, pipe_ends_sealed}` is all `yes` (treating `occluded` as a partial credit, not pass)

A `scorable` photo that fails any of the above is counted as "photo present but quality insufficient" (the YELLOW driver). A photo that fails the relevance gate is dropped from the segment entirely (logged in a separate bucket).

## What we cannot assess

The reference deck also requires **RTK GPS survey verification** (centimeter-grade survey data). We do not have RTK data for this dataset — only photo-overlay GPS at ±3.79m accuracy. We frame this explicitly in the pitch: "We assess the photo half of compliance. RTK survey verification is a complementary future phase."

## What data we have (in `Resources/`)

- **3,929 trench photos** (`Fotos-...zip`) — Maria Rain, Carinthia. Mixed WhatsApp uploads + a TimePhoto-style overlay app (also occasionally GPS Map Camera). **No EXIF GPS.** Each photo has a printed overlay with date + street address; ~70% also have lat/lon printed.
  - **Hidden duplicate ground truth in filenames.** 1027 files carry an `N_` prefix (`1_IMG-...`, `2_IMG-...`). Same image stem appearing under multiple N_ prefixes = same photo submitted to multiple jobs. **471 unique stems → 556 known duplicates pre-labeled by the submission system.** Plus 43 files with the Russian `— копия` ("copy") suffix. Together ~600 known duplicates for free — perfect ground truth for our pHash dedup recall check.
- **219 labeled example photos** (`Beispiele-...zip`) — these are a **labeled subset of Fotos**, not separate data:
  - `Beispiele/depth/` — 114 photos labeled "depth-primary" (measuring rod is the dominant feature)
  - `Beispiele/duct/` — 105 photos labeled "duct-primary" (cable bundle is the dominant feature)
  - 0 overlap between depth/ and duct/ — labels are mutually exclusive
  - 4 root exemplars: `bad.jpeg`, `duct_sand.jpg`, `duct_depth.jpg`, `warnband.jpeg`. Used as few-shot anchors in the Claude prompt.
  - **Use these as a calibration set:** after the batch run, measure our classifier's accuracy at predicting phase=`depth_measure` for `Beispiele/depth/` photos and phase=`duct_laid` for `Beispiele/duct/` photos. Becomes a pitch-able accuracy number.
- **Geo data** (`CLP20417A-P1-B00__...zip`) — one cluster: POP file empty, 9 FCPs, 2,983 trench LineString segments, FCP polygons, SiteCluster polygon. CRS **WGS84 / EPSG:4326** — no reprojection.
  - **Coverage gotcha:** FCP polygons cover 102.8% of the SiteCluster but with 18.7% gap inside the cluster and 21.5% spill outside. Point-in-polygon alone isn't sufficient for FCP assignment — need a nearest-FCP fallback when an address falls into a gap.
- **Reference decks** (`oegig_ai_qc_*.pptx`) — ÖGIG-themed, **but contain the actual scoring rubric** (per-segment, photo-every-5m, 6 photo-compliance criteria). Pitch arc borrowed; rubric adopted; cost numbers used pending Martin's APG-specific replacements.
- **The brief** (`Hackathon Challenge_ ... .docx`) — source of truth. 6 APG checks: warning tape, sand bedding, side view, depth, duplicate, GPS-consistent.

## Stack (locked, see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml))

Python 3.11 + uv · Streamlit (no FastAPI — one process) · **Claude Sonnet 4.6** vision as QC engine (upgraded from Haiku 4.5 after a 5-photo head-to-head: Sonnet wins 3/5 on hard cases — night shots, multi-phase priority, edge-of-frame tape — for ~$15 batch cost vs Haiku's ~$5; the $10 delta buys correctness on the hardest demo cases) · `imagehash` (pHash) + Pillow ELA for forensics · `geopandas` + `folium` for geo · `pillow-heif` defensive for HEIC (current data is JPEG, keep it). No YOLO. No torch. No `easyocr`/`paddleocr`.

## Pipeline (named stages, each in its own file)

```
01 ingest       → walk photos, load GeoJSONs into geopandas
02 forensics    → pHash dedup across the corpus (cheap, no API) + ELA pass for tamper hints
03 readqc       → ONE Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision call per unique photo: phase + relevance + overlay fields + 7 visual checks (incl. pipe_ends_sealed, personal_data_visible)
04 geomatch     → snap each photo to a precise point on the trench network:
                  (a) Overlay lat/lon → nearest LineString segment + position along that segment
                  (b) Address-only photos → forward-geocode via Nominatim → nearest LineString within the FCP polygon
                  (c) Cross-check: if lat/lon and geocoded-address disagree by >150m AND different street → flag
                  (d) Paper-label FCP + R code (when present) → consistency check against the snapped segment
05 classify     → per-segment rollup:
                  - sort photos by position along the segment
                  - check the 5m density rule
                  - check each photo's compliance status (passes phase-relevant subset of checks 1-7, fails check 8)
                  - verdict: GREEN / YELLOW / RED
06 report       → Streamlit UI: folium map (LineStrings colored by verdict) + clickable segment panel + downloadable deficiency CSV; surface the "obvious-error" flags (duplicates + geo-mismatch + personal-data-present) at the top
```

**Pre-filter ordering rationale:**
- **Dedup runs *before* the Claude call** so we don't pay to score the same image twice. One representative per pHash cluster goes through `readqc`; duplicates inherit its result with a `duplicate_of=…` tag. Bonus: the 1027 `N_`-prefixed filenames give us ground-truth duplicate pairs to validate pHash recall.
- **Relevance gate inside `readqc`:** Claude returns `relevance ∈ {scorable, portrait, off_topic, unreadable}`. `portrait` / `off_topic` / `unreadable` photos are **hard-dropped from scoring** (logged separately in the report as "not classified" with reason) — they don't drag a segment's score down. `scorable` photos go to the density rollup.
- **Personal-data gate inside `readqc`:** Claude returns `personal_data_visible: yes/no`. Photos with `yes` are excluded from the segment's compliance count and listed in a "needs retake" bucket — addresses NIS2 without claiming pixel-level pre-filtering.
- **Lat/lon ↔ address sanity check:** post-process `readqc` — forward-geocode the printed address (Nominatim, cached) and haversine-compare to printed coords. Threshold **>150 m AND different street** → flag. Within-street disagreement (overlay says "7 Bahnhofstraße", paper label says "Bahnhofstraße 9") is *normal* and not a fraud signal — paper documents the property being connected, overlay documents where the photographer is standing.

Folder skeleton to create first thing Saturday morning:

```
src/
  ingest.py        # walk Fotos/, load GeoJSONs into geopandas, write manifest.sqlite
  forensics.py     # imagehash pHash dedup + Pillow ELA tamper pass
  readqc.py        # one Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision call per unique photo → QCResult Pydantic
  geomatch.py      # snap each photo to a LineString segment (lat/lon → nearest; address → Nominatim → nearest within FCP)
  classify.py      # per-segment 5m density rollup → GREEN/YELLOW/RED
  report.py        # Streamlit + folium UI; deficiency CSV; "not classified" / "personal-data" buckets
app.py             # `streamlit run app.py` entrypoint
scripts/           # one-off spikes (already committed: spike_qc_schema.py, spike_nominatim.py, spike_sonnet_vs_haiku.py)
data/              # gitignored — Fotos/, Beispiele/, geo/
```

Each stage prints what it did in plain English. Example: `[readqc] 3,372 photos scored, 9 parse failures → readqc_failures.json` and `[geomatch] 2,948 snapped to segment, 384 FCP-only (gap), 17 off-cluster → geomatch.csv`.

## Data contracts (locked — don't change without saying so)

Every stage reads one or two files and writes exactly one. Column names, JSON keys, and file paths are fixed so two people can work on different stages in parallel without colliding.

All intermediate files live under `data/processed/` (gitignored). Photo paths are stored **relative** to `data/Fotos/Fotos/` so the manifest survives a move.

### 1. ingest → `data/processed/manifest.sqlite`

One row per photo file on disk. The source of truth for "what photos exist."

Table `photos`:
| column | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `photo_id` | TEXT PRIMARY KEY | sha1 of the file bytes — stable across renames |
| `rel_path` | TEXT | path relative to `data/Fotos/Fotos/` (e.g. `WhatsApp Image 2024-08-26 at 20_50_39 (1).jpeg`) |
| `filename` | TEXT | basename only — used to detect `N_` and `— копия` duplicate prefixes |
| `bytes` | INTEGER | file size |
| `mtime` | REAL | filesystem mtime, unix seconds |

Plus loaded into memory (not persisted): `trenches_gdf` (2,983 LineStrings), `fcps_gdf` (9 polygons), `cluster_gdf` (1 polygon), all WGS84.

### 2. forensics → `data/processed/forensics.jsonl`

One JSON object per `photo_id`. Reads `manifest.sqlite`, writes one line per photo.

```json
{
  "photo_id": "...",
  "phash": "f0e1c2...",                  // 16-char hex perceptual hash
  "phash_cluster_id": 42,                 // shared by all photos within Hamming-6 of each other; lowest photo_id wins as representative
  "is_phash_representative": true,        // one true per cluster; only these go to readqc
  "ela_score": 0.0731,                    // mean ELA delta — higher = more re-saved
  "ela_flag": false                       // ela_score > THRESHOLD (set after calibration)
}
```

### 3. readqc → `data/processed/readqc.jsonl`

One JSON object per **representative** photo (i.e. `is_phash_representative=true` in forensics). Reads `forensics.jsonl` + the photo bytes from disk. Schema = the `QC_SCHEMA` block above, plus three bookkeeping fields:

```json
{
  "photo_id": "...",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "cost_usd": 0.0046,
  "relevance": "scorable",
  "phase": "duct_laid",
  "warning_tape_visible": "no",
  "sand_bedding_visible": "yes",
  "side_view_present": "yes",
  "depth_reference_visible": "no",
  "depth_value_cm": null,
  "duct_visible": "yes",
  "pipe_ends_sealed": "occluded",
  "personal_data_visible": "no",
  "overlay_date": "26.08.2024 20:50",
  "overlay_address": "11 Josef-Petritsch-Straße, Maria Rain, Kärnten, Austria",
  "overlay_latlon": "46°33'29.30965\"N 14°17'23.54444\"E",
  "paper_label_code": "F170-R084-11-or",
  "note": "..."
}
```

Photos with `is_phash_representative=false` inherit their representative's row at the rollup stage — they don't get their own readqc row.

### 4. geomatch → `data/processed/geomatch.csv`

One row per photo (representative + duplicates inherit). Reads `readqc.jsonl` + the trench/FCP GeoJSONs. CSV (not JSONL) because downstream is tabular.

| column | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `photo_id` | str | matches `manifest.sqlite` |
| `lat`, `lon` | float \| empty | decimal degrees parsed from `overlay_latlon`, or geocoded from `overlay_address` |
| `coord_source` | enum | `overlay_latlon` / `geocoded_address` / `none` |
| `segment_id` | str \| empty | snapped LineString's `externalID` from Trenches.geojson (e.g. `SDIRouteSection_10985384961_1726897473` — the only unique identifier in the file) |
| `segment_t` | float | position along the segment as a fraction 0..1 (so we can sort photos along the segment) |
| `snap_distance_m` | float | how far the photo's point was from the LineString it snapped to |
| `fcp_name` | str \| empty | FCP polygon that contains the point (or nearest, if in a gap) |
| `fcp_assignment` | enum | `inside_polygon` / `nearest_fallback` / `off_cluster` |
| `label_match` | enum | `ok` / `fcp_mismatch` / `r_mismatch` / `no_label` — paper-label consistency vs snapped segment |
| `latlon_vs_address_flag` | bool | true if geocoded address >150m from overlay coords AND different street |

### 5. classify → `data/processed/verdicts.csv`

One row per LineString segment (2,983 rows). Reads `readqc.jsonl` + `geomatch.csv` + `forensics.jsonl` + the geo data.

| column | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `segment_id` | str | LineString `externalID` from Trenches.geojson |
| `fcp_name` | str | parent FCP |
| `length_m` | float | segment length in meters |
| `photo_count` | int | photos snapped to this segment (after dedup) |
| `compliant_photo_count` | int | photos that pass the "all checks ok" filter in Layer B |
| `max_gap_m` | float | longest stretch without a compliant photo |
| `density_photos_per_5m` | float | `compliant_photo_count / (length_m / 5)` |
| `verdict` | enum | `GREEN` / `YELLOW` / `RED` |
| `reasons` | str | semicolon-joined human-readable reasons (e.g. `"max gap 12m > 5m; 1 personal-data photo"`) |

### 6. report → `data/processed/report/`

Reads `verdicts.csv` + `geomatch.csv` + `readqc.jsonl`. Writes:
- `deficiency.csv` — one row per RED or YELLOW segment with reasons, for the partner.
- `not_classified.csv` — photos dropped by relevance gate (portrait/off_topic/unreadable).
- `personal_data.csv` — photos flagged NIS2-sensitive.
- `summary.html` — one-page overview shown alongside the live Streamlit map.

Streamlit (`app.py`) reads the same files at startup. No live Claude calls during the demo.

## The geomatch redesign (corrected after PPT review)

**Two earlier pivots and one correction:**

1. **Old plan (PLAN.md v1) assumed EXIF GPS for segment positioning.** Wrong — 0/50 random photos sampled have any EXIF. WhatsApp strips it. The geolocation signal is **overlay-OCR'd lat/lon + address + paper-label FCP code**, not EXIF.

2. **First pivot moved to per-FCP+duct (R-code) granularity** because paper labels don't encode segment IDs. **That pivot was wrong** — it ignored the reference ÖGIG deck's rubric, which is explicitly per-segment with a 5m photo-density rule.

3. **Correction (now):** scoring unit is **per LineString segment** (2,983 cells across the 9 FCPs). Segment positioning is achieved via **overlay lat/lon → nearest-LineString snap**, not via paper labels. Paper labels are a *consistency check* (FCP + R code should match the snapped segment), not the primary geomatch signal.

**Pitch line:** "2,983 trench segments across 9 zones. We can tell you, segment by segment, which ones have compliant photo coverage every 5 meters and which ones have gaps."

**Why a vision model, not OCR + regex (research + 21-photo eyes-on sample):**
- **Overlay position varies.** Bottom-right (TimePhoto family, most common), top-right (TimeStamp Camera with English locale), top-left (GPS Map Camera, with its own watermark). No fixed crop covers all cases.
- **Lat/lon has at least four formats in the wild:** DMS-period (`46°33'56.226"N 14°17'5.222"E`), **DMS-comma-decimal** (`46°33'29,30965"N 14°17'23,54444"E` — German locale), decimal-no-separators (`46.56153856N 14.28786228E`), labeled-decimal (`Lat 46.551972, Long 14.294088`).
- **Language mixes German, English, Russian (Cyrillic), and partial transliterations** on the *same* fields — country renders as `Austria` / `Австрия` / `Kärnten`; city as `Maria Rain` / `Мария-Райн`; months as `авг.` / `ноя6.` / `Oct`.
- **~30% of sampled photos show no visible lat/lon at all** — just date + address.
- **Overlay can be partially occluded** by paper labels held against the camera.
- A regex pipeline would silently fail on a meaningful fraction; Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision handles every variation in one shot, returns structured JSON, classifies phase, reads the paper FCP label, and assigns relevance — one call.

**What we do:**
1. **One Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision call per unique photo** (post-dedup) returns the overlay fields, the 7 per-photo visual checks (warning tape, sand bedding, side view, depth reference, duct visible, pipe ends sealed, personal data visible), the phase, and the relevance gate — see schema below. The other 2 rubric items (duplicate detection, GPS-consistency) are handled outside this call: duplicate detection in `forensics.py` via pHash; GPS-consistency in `geomatch.py` via lat/lon ↔ geocoded address haversine check.
2. **Geo-snap order of preference:**
   - Lat/lon printed → snap to nearest LineString in `Trenches.geojson` (and record position along it).
   - Address only → Nominatim forward-geocode → snap to nearest LineString within the matching FCP polygon.
   - Neither → photo enters the "unmappable" bucket; counts toward FCP-level totals but not segment-level.
3. **Cross-checks (after snap):**
   - If lat/lon AND address both present, geocode the address and check the haversine distance to the printed coords. Threshold **>150 m AND different street** → flag. (Same-street disagreement is normal: paper label = property being connected, overlay = photographer's location.)
   - If paper label `F###-R###` present, check the FCP and duct of the snapped segment match. Mismatch → flag.
4. **Off-cluster handling.** Confirmed working: Lambichl (a neighboring village) addresses geocode to a point ~1.7 km outside the SiteCluster polygon — correctly flagged as off-cluster, not silently dropped.
5. **Density rollup per segment.** Sort the snapped points by position along the segment. The segment is GREEN if no >5 m gap exists between consecutive compliant photos AND the start and end of the segment are each within 5 m of a compliant photo. YELLOW if photos exist but gaps > 5 m or quality fails. RED if no compliant photos at all.

**Paper-label codes** look like `F170-R084-11-or`: `F170` → `fcpName` in `FCPs.geojson`, `R084` → `ductMainShort` in `Trenches.geojson` (200 unique R-codes), `-11-` is the slot in the cable bundle and `-or` is the duct colour. The slot+colour identify the *specific cable*, not the LineString segment — so paper labels are a consistency check on the snapped segment's FCP/R, not the primary geomatch signal.

System prompt loads the 4 root exemplars (`bad`, `duct_sand`, `duct_depth`, `warnband`) once with a cache breakpoint. **Note:** `scripts/spike_qc_schema.py` validates the v2 5-check schema (no `pipe_ends_sealed`, no `personal_data_visible`); the production `src/readqc.py` extends to the 7-check schema above. The Pydantic class in the spike script is the reference template — copy-and-extend.

## 48-hour timeline (loose, spine firm)

### Friday tonight — DONE (research, no code yet)

Friday evening was spent on a deep data audit + AI spike + the PPT-rubric discovery + a re-spike. Output: this plan, locked. Spine work moved to Saturday early morning.

Concrete deliverables committed Friday night: PLAN.md, DECISIONS.md, `scripts/spike_qc_schema.py`, `scripts/spike_nominatim.py`, `scripts/spike_sonnet_vs_haiku.py`.

### Saturday early-AM (08:00 → 09:00) — pre-batch sanity
- Folder skeleton + `src/ingest.py` (walk Fotos/, load GeoJSONs into geopandas).
- One Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision call working end-to-end on a single photo, full JSON parses via Pydantic.
- Folium map showing SiteCluster polygon + 2,983 trench segments.
- Streamlit page: "loaded 3,929 photos, here's the map."

### Saturday morning (09:00 → 14:00)
- **pHash dedup FIRST** — process the whole corpus locally (no API cost). Validate recall against the ~600 known duplicates from N_ prefixes + копия suffix.
- **Batch readqc**: send each unique photo (post-dedup) to Claude Sonnet 4.6. Cost: ~3,400 calls × ~$0.0045 ≈ **$15**. ELA tamper pass runs in parallel.
- **Geomatch**: snap each photo to a LineString via overlay lat/lon (primary) or geocoded address + nearest-LineString within nearest FCP polygon (fallback). Log unmatched.
- **Classify**: per-segment 5m density rollup → GREEN/YELLOW/RED verdict. Account for the 18.7% FCP-polygon gaps (nearest-FCP fallback).
- **Calibration check**: measure phase-classifier agreement against Beispiele/depth (114 photos labeled depth-primary) and Beispiele/duct (105 photos labeled duct-primary). Becomes a pitchable accuracy number.
- **Goal by 14:00:** segments coloring green/yellow/red on the map; "not classified" + "personal-data" + "geo-mismatch" buckets populated.

### Saturday afternoon (14:00 → 17:00)
- Click a red segment → side panel with photo grid + per-photo phase + signal table + Claude's note + gap analysis ("no compliant photo between meter 12 and meter 31").
- Deficiency report: CSV + a one-page HTML summary.
- **17:00 tech checkpoint with Sustainista.** Show what works.

### Saturday evening (17:00 → 23:00)
- Pre-rig the demo set-piece: 4–5 photos (one clean, one duplicate pair, one tampered, one with missing bedding).
- 5-slide deck (see below).
- **Record a 90-second backup demo video.** Non-negotiable.

### Sunday (09:00 → 10:30)
- Two full pitch rehearsals. Cut anything that takes >15 seconds to load.
- 10:30 — pitch.

## Killer demo moves (steal these)

1. **Live tamper:** mid-pitch, doctor a photo on stage → run it → tool flags it.
2. **The "wrong segment" catch:** show two near-identical photos submitted to different segments → tool calls duplicate-use.
3. **Click the red segment:** map mostly green with one screaming red trench segment → click → photo grid + a gap-analysis line ("no compliant photo between meter 12 and meter 31 of this 47-meter segment").
4. **Cost on screen:** "this segment protects €X of grid asset" — translates ML to euros.

## Pitch outline (5 slides, 3 minutes) — hybrid: ÖGIG deck arc, pruned, recontextualized to APG

Slides are rails — demo eats ≥60% of the 3 minutes. Each slide is 1 sentence + 1 visual, no walls of text.

1. **Hook — "A hidden risk in every meter."** APG has 424,000 trench photos. Engineers review them by hand. Manipulation, re-use, and missing-documentation go undetected today. Each undocumented fiber cut during future road works costs €120K+; a 3–5× multiplier when liability cannot be proven. (Numbers borrowed from the ÖGIG reference deck — APG-specific numbers if Martin confirms tomorrow.)
2. **Good vs bad — visual proof.** Side-by-side: one compliant photo (open trench, GPS stamp, duct bundle visible, sand bedding, ruler readable, no persons) vs one non-compliant photo (dark, occluded, no duct visible). Establishes our checklist in the audience's head with zero technical jargon.
3. **THE DEMO.** Streamlit map, 9 colored FCP zones, 2,983 colored trench segments. Click a RED segment → photo grid + the specific reasons it's red ("no compliant photo between meter 12 and meter 31"; "photo X reused from job Y"; "photo Z contains a worker's face — NIS2 violation"). This is where we spend ~60% of the time.
4. **How it works in one diagram.** 5 stages: Ingest → AI Review → Geo-Match → Classify → Report. Manual review: 3–5 days per section. Our run: <30 minutes for the entire 3,929-photo dataset, cost ~$15.
5. **CTA — "Approve, define KPIs, scale."** Pilot on Maria Rain works (today). Same pipeline scales to APG's 424,000-photo portfolio. NIS2 audit trail and contractor accountability are free side-effects of the build.

## Open questions for Martin Fuhrmann (only when we see him in person)

Most prior questions have been answered by inspection. Remaining items are pitch/positioning, not blockers:

1. **Is APG the partner alone, or APG + ÖGIG joint?** Brief says APG; data is ÖGIG-style fiber work. Affects which logo and language we lead with.
2. **For the demo: is duplicate-photo-reuse-across-jobs a real APG operational pain, or is missing-evidence the bigger pain?** Decides which demo move we open with — fraud reveal or coverage-gap reveal.

The technical plan does not depend on these answers.

## Risks / what not to do

- **Don't rebuild the EXIF-GPS path.** 0/50 random photos sampled have any EXIF (WhatsApp strips it). OCR the overlay instead.
- **Don't try a fixed-crop + regex overlay parser.** Overlay position, lat/lon format, and language all vary across the corpus. Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision is the extractor.
- **Don't hard-code a trench-depth number.** The brief and the ÖGIG deck both treat "is a depth reference visible" as the check, not a numeric threshold. Keep it that way.
- **Don't burn time on pixel-level privacy redaction.** Claude flags `personal_data_visible`; the report excludes those photos and routes them to a "needs retake" bucket. NIS2-aware, not over-engineered.
- **Don't commit `Resources/`, `data/`, or `scripts/out/`.** NDA on route data + actual addresses appear in the spike output.
- **Don't depend on live Claude calls during the live pitch.** Pre-run Saturday night; cache the JSON; demo reads from disk (except any judge-handed photo).
- **Don't pivot silently.** Anyone changing approach says it out loud — this doc is the source of truth.
